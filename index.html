                    <strong>About This Program:</strong> <a href="https://codingnomads.co/learn" target="_blank" class="is-link">CodingNomads</a> #StayAtHome Mentorship Program is a free service 
                    that pairs voluntary mentors with people who lost their jobs due to COVID-19, and who would like to explore new skills.
                    This is an experimental program, and we are in the preliminary phase of rolling it out. 
                    The program leverages our network and community to connect skilled mentors with motivated learners.
                    Our goal and our hope is to help people use their time at home for education, to emerge 
                    from this crisis with more connections and new skills. You can help by volunteering just <strong>one hour of your time</strong> 
                    per week for four short weeks.</p>
            
                <p class="content">
                    <strong>Why We're Launching This Program Now:</strong> Millions of people worldwide are facing dire straits due to workplaces 
                    closing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-isolation currently seems to be the most
                    effective way to slow the outbreak, lighten the load on our public health system, and save lives.
                    However, self-isolation forces many people to make an impossible choice between staying home and forgoing 
                    necessary income, versus potentially spreading the virus and continuing to go to work. 
                    Many essential workers are continuing to go to work and are helping to keep our communities as stable and 
                    safe as possible. Many others were not even given the chance to make that choice, and are now unemployed 
                    and without income due to lock-downs and the unfolding economic crisis.</p>

                <p class="content">
                    <strong>Help Others Learn Tech Skills:</strong> Simply having technical skills will not solve the
                    economic and societal problems we are currently facing, but it can help some people to put themselves 
                    in a more stable position, and gives us all the opportunity to help build more sustainable systems for our communities. 
                    In terms of financial stability, tech jobs are still some of the
                    best paid and most in-demand positions in many places around the world, and they can give many
                    people the opportunity to work remotely. Being able to create value remotely and get paid even
                    during a situation like the current COVID-19 lock-downs is a privilege that we would like
                    to make as available as possible to affected workers.</p>

                <p class="content">
                    <strong>Who Is Eligible For This Program:</strong> As a <strong>mentor</strong>, if you have demonstrable skills and 
                    work experience in any technical role related to software design and development, and you'd like to share those
                    skills with eager learners, then we'd love to hear from you. As a <strong>student</strong>, this program is open to people
                    who have recently lost work due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and are committed to self-isolating to 
                    flatten the curve. If you are interested in finding a mentor,

                    <strong>You Can Make A Difference:</strong> By giving just 1 hour of your time per week per student, your mentorship can
                    have a positive impact in someone's life. 
                    Learning new technical skills is not easy, and we know from experience that having a mentor to talk things over with on a
                    regular basis can make all the difference. This is where you come in. You can help someone get started in tech
                    by being at their side for 1 month, or more if you can. 4 hours of your time can help change someone‚Äôs life for the better.

                        There is absolutely no contractual obligation for becoming a volunteer mentor. 
                        However, for the students‚Äô sake we are asking that you commit to at least 4 weeks 
                        of mentorship, 1 meeting per week - a total of only 4 hours of your time. 
                        We understand that your situation can change, but for the time being please 
                        indicate how long you think you will be able to help, and for how many students. 
                        It's all in the form below. We are happy to guide you and instruct you
                        on how to go about working with your student(s). Mentoring students can be a great experience!
