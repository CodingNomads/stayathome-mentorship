### Info

This is a **pro-bono effort** on all fronts. We don't charge anyone to make this connection and we will provide our learning materials available for free for qualifying students. We will only pair you with students that are in economic troubles due to COVID-19.

There is absolutely no contractual obligation that you commit to when indicating that you want to help out. We just want to try to create an opportunity for people that are currently in a unfortunate situation. We understand that your situation can change as well and that you won't be able to continue mentoring someone.

It is easier for us to set something up if we have some numbers to calculate with. Therefore, please indicate how long you think you will be able to help, and for how many students. It's all in [the form](https://codingnomads.github.io/stayathome-mentorship/index.html). Thank you!
