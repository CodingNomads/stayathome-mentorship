### Info

CodingNomadsâ€™ #StayAtHome Mentorship Program is a **pro-bono effort** to help everyone make the best use of their time at home, and emerge from this crisis stronger, better educated, and more united. 

We don't charge anyone to make the connection between students and volunteer mentors, and we will provide our available learning materials for free for qualifying students. We will only pair you with students that are in economic troubles due to COVID-19.

There is absolutely no contractual obligation for becoming a volunteer mentor. However for the studentsâ€™ sake we are asking that you commit to at least 4 weeks of mentorship, 1 meeting per week - a total of only 4 hours of your time! We understand that your situation can change, but for the time being please indicate how long you think you will be able to help, and for how many students. It's all in [the form](https://codingnomads.github.io/stayathome-mentorship/index.html). Thank you!
