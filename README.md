**Note**: This is a **pro-bono effort** on all fronts. We don't charge learners to make this connection and make our learning materials available for free
for qualifying students. We will _only_ pair you with students that are in economic troubles due to COVID-19.

If find out that you enjoy mentoring and want to make this a source of income,
please reach out to CodingNomads after this situation has calmed down. We're always looking for skilled and dedicated mentors
to help learners break into tech. 

Stay safe and healthy and help #flattenthecurve!
